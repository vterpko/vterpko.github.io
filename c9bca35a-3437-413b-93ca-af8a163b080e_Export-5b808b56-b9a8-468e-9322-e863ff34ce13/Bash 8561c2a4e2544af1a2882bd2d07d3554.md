### Command execution

```bash
echo 'This is the command before the line break'; echo 'This is the command after the line break'

echo 'This is the first command' && echo 'This command will execute only if the first one is successful'

echo 'This is the first command' || echo 'This command will execute only if the first one fails'

echo "This is command substitution $(echo 'New command')."

echo "This is also command substitution `echo 'New command'`."

echo "This is an arithmetic operation - $((3+3))"
```

### Redirections

```bash
echo "this text will be fed into grep" | grep -o "text"

cat <<_EOF | grep 't'
this is a
multiline
text dump
which
will be
fed into grep
_EOF

echo 'overwrite stdout to file.txt' > file.txt

cat <<_EOF > file.txt
this is a
multiline
text dump
which
will be
written to file.txt
_EOF

echo 'append stdout to file.txt' >> file.txt

cat <<_EOF >> file.txt
this is a
multiline
text dump
which
will be
appended to file.txt
_EOF

echo 'stderr to file.txt' 2> file.txt

echo 'stdout and stderr to file.txt'  &> file.txt

echo 'stderr to stdout' 2>&1

echo 'stderr into void' 2> /dev/null
```

### Comments

```bash
# this is a single line comment
```

### Quotations

```bash
echo 'These are the strict quotation marks which will output only the literal values'

	
echo "These are the non-strict quotation marks which will interpret the metacharacters"
```

### Functions

```bash
func() {
	echo 'This is a function'
	echo 'Everything inside this block of code can be referenced with the word "func"'
}

function anotherFunc() {
	echo 'This is also a function'
}

function shortFunc {
  echo 'This is yet another function'
}
```

## Control Flows

### AND operator

```bash
echo 'This is the first command' && echo 'This command will execute only if the first one is successful'
```

### OR operator

```bash
echo 'This is the first command' || echo 'This command will execute only if the first one fails'
```

### If statement

```bash
if [ condition1 ]; then
		echo "Condition1 is true";
elif [ condition2 ]; then
		echo "Condition2 is true";
elif [ condition3 ]; then
		echo "Condition3 is true";
else
		echo "Non of the conditions are true";
fi
```

### Case statement

```bash
case $variable in
		"string1")
				echo "variable is equal to string1";
				;;
		"string2")
				echo "variable is equal to string2";
				;;
		"string3")
				echo "variable is equal to string3";
				;;
		*)
				echo "variable is neither of the strings";
				;;
esac
```

## Loops

### While

```bash
while [ condition ]; do
	echo "The condition is true."
done
```

```bash
while true; do
	echo "Will run until termination."
done
```

```bash
cat file.txt | while read line; do
	echo "${line}"
done
```

```bash
cat <<EOF | while read line; do
	echo "${line}"
done
> line1
> line2
> line3
> EOF
```

```bash
while read line; do
	echo "${line}"
done < file.txt
```

```bash
while read line; do
	echo "${line}"
done <<EOF
> line1
> line2
> line3
> EOF
```

### For

```bash
for var in ${array[*]}; do
	echo "${var}"
done
```

```bash
for number in {1..999..10}; do
	echo "${number}"
done
```

```bash
for number in {one,two,three,four,five}; do
	echo "${number}"
done
```

### Until

```bash
until [ condition ]; do
	echo "The condition is false."
done
```

### Select

```bash
select variable in ${array[*]}; do
	echo "${variable} selected"
	[ -e "${variable}" ] || break
done
```

### Break

```bash
for number in {1..10}; do
	while true; do
		echo "This is the most inner loop."
		[ condition ] && break
	done
done
```

```bash
while [ condition ]; do
	until [ condition ]; do
		while true; do
			echo "This is the most inner loop."
			[ condition ] && break 2
		done
	done
done
```

### Continue

```bash
for number in {1..10}; do
	while [ condition ]; do
		echo "This is the most inner loop."
		[ condition ] && continue
		echo "Some more text."
	done
done
```

```bash
until [ condition ]; do
	for number in {1..100..10}; do
		for file in /var/log/daemon.log*; do
			echo "This is the most inner loop."
			[ condition ] && continue 2
			echo "Some more text."
		done
	done
done
```
